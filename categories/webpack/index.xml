      <description>I have been working on my new Vue application and It was working great until I build my application with command npm run build . I was unhappy with the build size as overall size is 8MB and initial load is 800Kb. It seem to much too me and want to reduce the bundle size by removing unnecessary packages.

Let&amp;rsquo;s check how we can analyze the issue.
1. Analyze webpack bundle Webpack Bundle Analyzer is a very good tool create an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of all bundles.</description>
